LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell state1/FSM_onehot_State_Current[4]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) state1/FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[1]/CLR, state1/FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[2]/CLR, state1/FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[3]/CLR, state1/FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[4]/CLR, state1/FSM_onehot_State_Current_reg[0]/PRE.

LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT Driver_MIPI0/Data_Read/U0/clock_system_inst/dly_gen.BUFGCTRL_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
